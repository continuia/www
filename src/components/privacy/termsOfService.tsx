# Continuia Terms of Service

_Last Updated: Aug 14th 2025_

**Applies to:** Patients, Clinicians, Institutional Partners

---

## Welcome to Continuia

We are honored to welcome you to Continuia, a service created to empower clarity in healthcare. Our goal is to support patients and clinicians with secure second opinions, robust analytics, and transparent digital tools, all guided by medical ethics and regulatory compliance.

---

## Scope of Services

Continuia offers access to remote, asynchronous second opinions from licensed physicians across various specialties. These opinions are purely educational and designed to provide you with an additional expert perspective to **support—not replace—your ongoing care**.

When a case is submitted, it undergoes a triage process that uses secure AI agents to match your submission with the most relevant and appropriately licensed clinician. That physician then reviews your case, analyzes the clinical data, and provides a written second opinion.
The turnaround time for most opinions ranges from **24 to 72 hours**, although this may vary based on the complexity of the case and availability of the clinician.

For institutions and care teams, Continuia integrates tools for internal governance reviews, cross-specialty collaboration, and audit-safe documentation. We serve as both an independent voice and an infrastructure layer supporting ethical decision-making.

---

## Who May Use Continuia

**Patients and Families:**  
You must be of legal age in your jurisdiction (typically 18 years or older), or a legal guardian authorized to act on behalf of a minor or dependent. You must be capable of providing informed consent and responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the medical information submitted. This includes details about your symptoms, history, test results, and the questions you wish to explore.

**Clinicians:**  
If you are engaging with Continuia as a physician or specialist, you must hold a valid and current license in your jurisdiction and be in good standing with your local medical board. You agree to provide second opinions within Continuia’s ethical framework, without directly treating or prescribing, and to follow documentation, consent validation, and turnaround guidelines.

**Institutions and Partners:**  
Organizations working with Continuia to provide clinical oversight, medical review, or patient access must be formally authorized to represent their patient base. Institutional users are responsible for ensuring compliance with local regulatory bodies and for protecting patient data submitted through our platform.

---

## Important Disclaimers

Continuia does **not** provide urgent or emergency care under any circumstances. Our services are not designed for acute symptom evaluation, and we are not an appropriate channel for crises or life-threatening situations. If you or someone you know is experiencing chest pain, difficulty breathing, sudden loss of consciousness, or any other medical emergency, you should immediately contact local emergency services or go to the nearest hospital.

The medical opinions provided through Continuia are based solely on the information you provide.
They are **second opinions** and are not to be construed as primary diagnoses or treatment plans.
Continuia does not assume liability for outcomes based on incomplete or inaccurate information submitted by users.

---

## Global Compliance and Jurisdiction

Continuia serves users in multiple countries and is committed to complying with local laws and standards related to patient privacy, data sovereignty, and telemedicine.

- **India:** Our services adhere to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP) and the Telemedicine Practice Guidelines (2020). Physicians providing second opinions do so in accordance with National Medical Council standards and are prohibited from prescribing treatment unless they have previously seen the patient in person.

- **United States:** Continuia operates in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We are not a covered entity unless specifically contracted under a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). All patient records are handled with end-to-end encryption, secure data storage, and access controls.

- **United Arab Emirates (Dubai):** We conform to the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) Telehealth regulations. Our platform ensures that second opinions offered to Dubai residents are rendered by qualified professionals who either hold DHA credentials or operate under approved cross-border frameworks.

---

## Consent and Privacy

By using Continuia, you give informed consent to the collection, processing, and use of your personal and health-related information for the purpose of obtaining a second opinion.

This includes:

- The review of submitted medical records by licensed healthcare professionals.
- The processing of your data by Continuia’s AI triage and summarization engines, which are designed to match you to an appropriate specialist and organize your information into a clinical narrative.
- The optional sharing of your medical file and opinion with your treating physician or care team, which can only occur with your explicit approval.

You may withdraw this consent at any time. However, if consent is withdrawn before a case is completed, we may not be able to provide you with a second opinion. If consent is withdrawn after the case has been closed, we will retain your data only to the extent required by applicable laws or for compliance with audit requirements.

Continuia’s privacy infrastructure follows the highest standards for data localization, encryption, and access management. Full details are available in our [Privacy Policy](https://continuia.ai/privacy).

---

## Accounts and Security

When you create a Continuia account, you agree to be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must not share your password or allow others to access your account.

We protect user information through advanced security measures, including encryption at rest and in transit, two-factor authentication, login alerts, and continuous access monitoring. If we detect unusual behavior or potential compromise of your account, we may temporarily suspend access until identity verification is completed.

Users are encouraged to use strong, unique passwords and to change them regularly.

---

## For Clinicians

Licensed physicians who provide second opinions through Continuia are bound by professional standards, contractual obligations, and regulatory laws.

You are expected to provide detailed, thoughtful, and medically sound assessments based on the materials submitted. You must deliver these within the timeframe outlined in your agreement with Continuia, typically **24 to 72 hours**. You are also responsible for disclosing any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, and for acknowledging limitations in your clinical expertise as they relate to the specific case.

You may **not** treat patients, write prescriptions, or engage in follow-up interactions outside of the Continuia platform. Soliciting patients, attempting to build a private client base, or contacting them outside the platform constitutes a breach of this agreement and will result in immediate termination.

All clinician responses are subject to periodic quality audits and documentation review to ensure compliance with Continuia’s internal governance policies.

---

## Payment and Refunds

Continuia offers transparent pricing, which is communicated to the user before any case is submitted. Payment is typically collected at the time of submission, unless otherwise agreed through a partner institution or enterprise contract.

A refund may be issued under the following circumstances:

- If no qualified clinician is available within 72 hours of submission
- If the submitted case is outside the scope of our service (e.g., emergency, pediatric, or non-supported specialties)
- If a regulatory restriction prevents us from legally rendering an opinion

Please note that Continuia does not currently process insurance claims. However, patients may request a detailed invoice to pursue potential reimbursement from their insurer.

---

## Data Ownership and Usage

You retain ownership of any health records, documents, or media you upload to Continuia. We do **not** sell or rent user data. All identifiable information remains confidential and is stored securely.

With your consent, we may use anonymized case data to train machine learning models, improve our triage systems, or support research in partnership with licensed academic or clinical bodies. These uses will never include personal identifiers unless you explicitly authorize such participation.

You have the right to request a copy of all data stored about you, and you may also request that we delete your records in accordance with local data retention laws. In some jurisdictions, we may be required to retain records for a legally mandated period (e.g., seven years for clinical documentation).

---

All content, technology, and platform assets of Continuia—including but not limited to our clinical agent frameworks, UI designs, triage protocols, logos, documentation formats, and summary templates—are the intellectual property of Continuia Health Technologies and may not be used, copied, or reproduced without written permission.

---

## Termination of Access

Continuia may suspend or permanently terminate access to any user who violates these Terms, misuses our platform, submits fraudulent information, or engages in behavior that compromises the safety or privacy of others.

Users may close their accounts at any time by contacting our support team. Data associated with the account will be retained or deleted in accordance with our privacy policy and applicable law.

---

## Disputes and Jurisdiction

Any disputes arising from the use of our platform will be handled based on the user’s region:

- **For users in India:** Disputes will be resolved through arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The venue for such arbitration shall be Hyderabad, India.
- **For users in the United States:** Disputes will be subject to binding arbitration in the state of Delaware, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
- **For users in Dubai:** Disputes will be escalated through the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) grievance system and, if unresolved, referred to UAE civil courts.

In all cases, users agree to waive any rights to participate in class action lawsuits or collective claims.

## Updates to These Terms

Continuia may modify or update these Terms of Service from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide at least fifteen (15) days’ notice via email and through notifications within the application. The updated terms will take effect on the specified effective date.
